bitshift
========

A program that demonstrates bit shifting. 

I did a phone interview a while back where I was asked to count the number of "one bits" in a decimal number. I didn't know too much about bit shifting, oddly. I just never learned it. I asked a friend how to answer the question. 

He wrote out the answer for me on a piece of paper and I finally had the chance to take a look at it while I was at my computer. This repository contains the results.
